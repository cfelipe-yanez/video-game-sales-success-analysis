# Video Game Sales Success Analysis

## Project Description

In this project, I work as a data analyst for **Ice**, an online store that sells video games worldwide. The dataset includes user and expert reviews, game genres, platforms (such as Xbox and PlayStation), ESRB ratings, and historical sales data from open sources.

The main objective is to **identify patterns that determine whether a video game is successful or not**. These insights help detect promising projects and support data-driven decisions when planning marketing and advertising campaigns.

The analysis is framed as if it were **December 2016**, with the goal of planning a campaign for **2017**. The focus is on developing strong data analysis skills rather than on making exact future sales predictions.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains historical data up to 2016 and includes, among others:

* Video game sales by region
* User and critic review scores
* Game genres and platforms
* Release year information
* ESRB ratings (`rating` column), which classify games by age group (e.g., Teen, Mature)

The **ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board)** rating system helps evaluate the suitability of games for different age audiences and is considered as part of the analysis.

## Project Goals

* Clean and preprocess the dataset
* Explore sales trends across platforms and genres
* Analyze the relationship between reviews, ratings, and sales
* Identify key factors associated with commercially successful games
* Provide insights to support marketing strategy decisions

## Tools and Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Output

The final output is a Jupyter Notebook containing:

* Data cleaning and preparation
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Visualizations and insights
* Clear conclusions supported by data
